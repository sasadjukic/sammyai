# 🏆 Best Practices Overview

## 🧭 The Core Philosophy: Collaborative Creation

SammyAI is designed to be your **writing partner**, not a magic wand. It excels at generating ideas, refining prose, and managing complex lore, but it thrives only when it understands your intent.

> [!NOTE]
> **A Partner, Not a Solution**
> There is no "magic button" for creative writing. SammyAI speeds up the process, but your creative energy, critical eye, and narrative vision are what turn raw text into a story.

## 🎯 The Power of Precision

The more specific you are, the more "human" and aligned with your voice the output will be. Vague prompts lead to generic results.

*   **Define Your Style**: Don't just ask to "write a scene." specify the tone. Is it *noir*, *whimsical*, *gritty*, or *cinematic*?
*   **Dictate the Pacing**: Tell SammyAI if a scene should be *fast-paced and punchy* or *slow and contemplative*.
*   **Provide Concrete Details**: Mention specific sensory details (smells, sounds, textures) you want included. This prevents the AI from falling into cliché descriptions.

## 👁️ Your Vision, Your Voice

Always remember that you are the editor-in-chief. SammyAI can provide multiple directions, but you must choose the one that fits your story's soul.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Human in the Loop**
> Always review and curate AI-generated content. Use the **DBE (Diff-Edits)** feature to surgically adjust dialogue or descriptions that don't quite hit the mark. Your unique perspective is what makes a story resonate with readers.
