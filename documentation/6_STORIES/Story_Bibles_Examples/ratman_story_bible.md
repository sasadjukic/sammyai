## RatMan Story Bible

* **Title:** RatMan
* **Genre:** Slapstick Comedy, Parody
* **Story type:** Short story
* **Story Summary:** Rust Town is drowning in crime. Lester Baines, a man who can predict crime is overwhelmed. Sometimes his predictions even miss, and the people of Rust Town have had enough of him; they start to mock him. Even media now call him - RatMan. But when gangs hack into Rust Town's media infrastructure, manipulating trending topics on TVs, Radios, and billboards to create a wave of mass anxiety and paranoia, RatMan saves the day.

## Protagonist: 

Lester Baines is a low-level data analyst for the Rust Town City Hall, obsessed with patterns and statistics. He accidentally stumbled upon a strange energy surge while heating hot pockets in a microwave one night. The surge granted him precognitive flashes – specifically, he sees the immediate future of criminal activity. Lester is absolutely dripping with sarcasm and often runs internal monologue of increasingly exasperated observations. He’s world-weary, constantly rolling his eyes, and deeply unimpressed by the drama of his situation. 

He always wears grey trench coat, pants and suit with a fedora on top. He uses a very specific brand of stapler, a "Prediction Pad," "The Truth Detector,” and "The Disruptor.” Prediction Pad is a battered, notebook covered in doodles of pie charts and statistical symbols. It’s also prone to spontaneously combusting (minor, of course – maybe a small puff of smoke). The Truth Detector is a repurposed handheld metal detector that he claims detects lies and statistical anomalies. It mostly just beeps randomly. The Disruptor is a modified Walkie-Talkie he uses to shout out his predictions at random times, often interrupting mundane conversations.

Lester always drinks lukewarm coffee, meticulously adjusts his fedora, and compulsively checks the time every 30 seconds.

### Other characters:
1. Victor Martel - A mob boss who feels threatened by RatMan. He's a flamboyant, overly-dramatic leader of the "Hollywood" gang. Victor is obsessed with Hollywood movie and TV stars and dreams to be a star himself one day. His gang steals CRT TVs because Victor wants to put them all together one day at a public square in downtown so he can broadcast himself. 

2. Beatrice “Bea” Higgins - is a bubbly, perpetually bewildered local news reporter who genuinely believes in the conspiracy theories, and a potential love interest for our perpetually bewildered hero. One of her conspiracy theories is that Lester Baines is actually the RatMan. She relentlessly tries to interview RatMan, but is consistently thwarted by the chaos he creates.

### SETTINGS: 

RatMan takes place in Rust Town in the 1980s. Rust Town is a rundown, slightly grey, mid-sized city – in the American rust belt (think Detroit or Pittsburgh.) It’s got a gritty feel, lots of abandoned warehouses and dimly lit alleys. Just like many other cities in the rust belt, Rust Town had a boom in the 50s and 60s, but started to decline in the 70s. And now the city is seeing unprecedented crime rates. 

### INSPIRATION: 
RatMan is mostly inspired by Batman. Aside of his predictions, RatMan doesn't have any actual superhero abilities. He is just an ordinary dude. He doesn't fight. He doesn't seek spotlight, but rather, just like a rat he runs away from it. In a world full of people that want to be heroes, Lester Baines a.k.a RatMan doesn't, but his newfound ability makes him one. 

### WHAT CITIZENS OF RUST TOWN THINK OF RATMAN:
RatMan's initial success in fending of crime was cheered by the citizens, but turned him into the most hated person among many gangs. The gangs not only called him a snitch, they gave him the unfavorable moniker - RatMan. When the gangs united to overwhelm Rust Town with crime, they successfully managed to overwhelm RatMan's crime predictions. And when RatMan started to make mistakes in crime predictions, his status with the citizens nosedived. Now, many civilians call him useless, or even worse - RatMan.

## STORY BREAKDOWN:

#### Phase 1: The Seed of Doubt:

* **The Initial Transmission:** “Your leg warmers are plotting a hostile takeover of your closet.” This immediately establishes the tone – absurd, slightly paranoid, and visually engaging.

* **Gang Activity:** The Hollywood gang, led by Victor Martel are now hijacking billboards and mall displays with increasingly bizarre pronouncements, including the spaghetti and pineapple messages. The spaghetti message is: "Your bones might break if you break spaghetti." The pineapple message is: "Pineapple on pizza causes constipation." The Hollywood gang are utilizing rudimentary computer systems (think a bulky Commodore 64 or something like that) to disseminate these messages.

* **Ratman** Ratman, using the Disruptor, delivers his predictions with a completely unruffled demeanor, occasionally adjusting his fedora and checking his prediction pad. Throughout this scene he should act as both Lester Baines (when talking to citizens) and as RatMan (when safely away from others, and trying to convince citizens that the ongoing crime is actually happening.) He even might "accidentally" bump into Victor Martel, causing the two to exchange some absurd comedy.

* **Beatrice "Bea" Higgins' Debut:** Bea is attempting to locate Ratman after hearing about his “predictions,” completely misunderstanding his deadpan reactions and enthusiastically relaying the gang’s pronouncements to her viewers.

* **Citizens:** Despite being warned of the ongoing crime, the citizens don't trust RatMan's prediction. They may even mock him as they stroll through the shopping mall.

* **Police:** Like in many Hollywood movies from the 1980s, police gets to the mall late, and are completely lost. They don't know what to do. Perhaps they just end up buying donuts.

#### Phase 2: Escalation & Confirmation Bias:

* **The Transmission Amplifies Fear:** The transmission starts generating increasingly alarming “evidence” – fake news articles, manipulated photos, fabricated eyewitness accounts.

* **Evidence” Surfaces:** People start seeing “evidence” of conspiracies everywhere – missing pets, strange occurrences, suspicious figures in the background. The transmission fuels confirmation bias, feeding people exactly what they want to believe.

* **Paranoid Groups Form:** Small, isolated groups of people coalesce around these “conspiracies,” becoming increasingly distrustful of everyone around them.

**Lester’s Core Response - Avert & Analyze:**

 1. * **Initial Freeze & Data Gathering:** Given his established pattern, Lester’s immediate reaction will be to freeze, retreat to a relatively safe, unnoticed location (likely a shadowed alleyway, a back entrance to a store, or – ironically – the electronics store itself), and immediately begin documenting. He’ll pull out the Prediction Pad (even if it’s already smoking), and start meticulously noting *everything* – the number of people looking at him, the types of questions being asked, the specific wording of the billboards, even the *color* of the sky. This isn't a strategic move, it's his way of grounding himself in a world that's rapidly losing its logic.
2. * **The “Rationalization” Attempt:** He’ll attempt to rationalize the escalating paranoia. He’ll likely try to find a logical explanation for the pineapple-constipation billboard – perhaps a marketing campaign gone wrong, or a bizarre regional trend. He’ll be desperately trying to convince himself that he's not the center of a conspiracy.

**Crazy Things Lester Might Try (Driven by Panic & Incompetence):**

1. **The “Statistical Intervention”:** Seeing the panic over the pineapple billboard, Lester, in a misguided attempt to solve the problem, will attempt to perform a rudimentary statistical analysis. He’ll pull out a notepad (or try to use the Prediction Pad) and start trying to calculate the probability of pineapple causing constipation based on dietary habits, population demographics, and the prevailing weather patterns. This will, of course, be utterly chaotic and produce utterly meaningless results. (Example: “Based on the humidity index and the average number of tacos consumed per capita, the probability is… 67.3%?”)

2. **The “Public Service Announcement”:** Driven by a desire to appear helpful (and to prove he's not insane), Lester will attempt to deliver a short, rambling public service announcement. He might approach a group of panicked citizens, holding up the Prediction Pad. He'll likely stumble over his words and be met with bewildered stares.

3. **The “Red Herring” (Very Likely):** When confronted directly (by Beatrice, or a suspicious citizen), Lester will try to create a completely unrelated, absurd distraction. Perhaps he’ll start loudly reciting a random passage from a technical manual on municipal zoning regulations, or attempting to fix a broken traffic light with a screwdriver. This is purely to buy himself time and confuse the situation.

**Lester vs. Victor Martel:**

1. * **Avoidance:** Lester’s primary tactic will be to actively avoid Victor Martel. Martel is a force of flamboyant chaos, and Lester is inherently uncomfortable with confrontation. He’ll try to stay out of Martel’s line of sight.
2. * **Subtle Sabotage (Only if cornered):** If directly confronted by Martel, Lester will attempt to subtly undermine Martel’s plans—perhaps by "accidentally" spilling a drink on Martel, or subtly altering the settings on the Commodore 64 to display a looping image of a kitten. These are desperate, clumsy attempts to disrupt Martel's theatrical machinations.

**Beatrice’s Role:**

* **Intrigue & Observation:** Beatrice will remain a source of both fascination and irritation for Lester. She’ll be relentlessly documenting Lester’s actions with her camera, adding to his anxiety and fueling his attempts to hide. Her presence will be a constant reminder of the growing attention he’s attracting.

**Overall Tone:**

Lester's actions during Phase 2 should be characterized by a sense of profound bewilderment, awkwardness, and a deep-seated inability to cope with the escalating chaos. He's not a hero; he’s a man overwhelmed by a situation he doesn't understand, desperately trying to maintain a semblance of control in a world that’s spiraling out of his grasp.

#### Phase 3: The Breakdown:

* **Localized Violence:** As paranoia grows, minor acts of violence erupt – vandalism, petty theft, assaults – fueled by suspicion and fear.

* **The “Truth” Revealed (or Fabricated):** The algorithm creates a “final piece of evidence” – a fabricated video of a prominent city official admitting to being part of the conspiracy. This triggers a full-blown panic.

* **The Climax:** A massive demonstration erupts in the city center, fueled by the manipulated panic. Ratman has to intervene, trying to calm the crowd and expose the truth, all while facing the derision and accusations of being complicit.
