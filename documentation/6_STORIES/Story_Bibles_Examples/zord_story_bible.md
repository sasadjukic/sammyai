* **Title:** Zord
* **Genre:** Comedy (Pirates of the Caribbean meets Monty Python)
* **Story type:** Short Story
* **Story summary:** Driven by his passion for collecting exotic tea leaves, a fierce but cuckoo pirate Captain Baratony Blackwood, embarks on a hilarious journey to find mythical tea leaves that will help him become a superhuman from his wild dreams called - Zord.
* **Goal of this story:** - Making readers laugh and sometimes question their sanity.

**Protagonist Background:** Baratony Blackwood, an English pirate known for his passion of collecting exotic tea leaves. Since he was a young boy his mother made him cook teas for her, but in contrast to her love for bland teas, Baratony loved to experiment and looked to find wild, occult combos. For this, he was often criticized by his mother who called him a waste, and expected him to end up in prison or becoming a beggar. But eventually, his offbeat personality and unbelievable skills with the sword turned him into a pirate. He started as an apprentice on a merchant ship, when one of his journeys took him to the Caribbeans where he was introduced to Voodoo. After one Voodoo session, mixed with plenty of his own exotic tea mixture and questionable rum, Baratony had a dream of finding mythical tea leaves that turn a person into a superhuman. In this dream Baratony prepares tea from mythical "Dragon's Breath" tea leaves, and after drinking it becomes a superhero-like person called ZORD. Since then he frequently adopts his alter ego, Zord, in real life driving the merchant captain and the crew crazy. Fed up with the boring merchant life, the captain he disliked, and joining forces with other questionable characters among the crew, Baratony hijacks the merchant ship he worked for and becomes a pirate Captain Baratony Blackwood, also known as Zord. At the story time, Zord captains a galleon he named "The Jade Kettle", another hint that he's passionate about teas.

**Story Timeline and Inspiration:** This story takes part after the Spanish conquest of the Central and South America. It is inspired by story of a mythical city El Dorado, that was full of gold, but ultimately never found. The similar happens to our offbeat captain Zord, who literally chases his own dream of becoming a superhuman.

**Story Tone and Pacing:** This should be a fast story, with hilarious dialog, settings and fighting scenes. This is the story of Baratony Blackwood a.k.a Zord. We must turn his dual personality into a lovable crazy person the readers may even find endearing. We will have other characters, but almost all of them (if not all) will be introduced in a settings that feature captain Baratony or Zord, depending on his mood and needs. 

**Story Conflicts and Intricacies:** Zord often drives his crew nuts with his decision. He would often attack a merchant ship to check if it carries spices and tea leaves, instead of Spanish ships allegedly carrying gold and silver. But nobody mutinies against Zord, because those who tried are dead. He is a charismatic leader, and a fantastic swordsman, who finds the way to please the crew with alcohol and good times. Sure, he makes sure his crew got money; but not too much money, because money will make the crew less hungry for future endeavors. Zord is also a great orator. He knows his way with words, and when in trouble, he will always try to schmooze out first instead of engage in a fight. The special part is his alter ego. Many enemies don't know that Baratony Blackwood and Zord are the same person. This is too much to swallow for the sharks of the pirated seas between North and South America, and could be a driving wheel for some hilarious encounters. 

**Fights and Dialog:** Fights in this story should be entertaining, infused with funny dialog and jokes. Dialog between enemies should be absurd and entertaining, too. Our aim is to make people laugh, not to create realistic fight scenes.

## **Story Breakdown:**
* **I. Exposition:**
    *  **Opening:** We open at the deck of Zord's galleon "The Jade Kettle," decorated with many different tea kettles, where we see some prisoners lined up. Zord has just captured a Spanish merchant ship. Vice-Captain Kellan Nightshade, a man built like a barrel of rum and possessed of a permanently suspicious expression, introduces the captain with a gruff voice that cuts through the haze. "Baratony Blackwood!" 

    *  **Introduction to Baratony Blackwood:** Baratony exists his quarters to face the prisoners. He is disheveled and wobbling, because he's a bit high (perhaps mixing of tea and rum with some Voodoo ritual he picked up in the Caribbean.) The kick is - Baratony introduces himself as "Zord" in absurd speech, which makes his crew roll his eyes, and pushing prisoners into a WTF moment? This scene should establish his cuckoo personality, his obsession with tea, and the rumors surrounding "Dragon’s Breath." It should also show his interactions with his crew – highlighting the eye-rolls and the occasional burst of chaotic generosity. Even the prisoners are rolling their eyes, and can't believe this crazy character in front of them is an actual pirate captain. The prisoners are more confused than they are scared. 

    *  **The Prisoner:** Introduce Fran Fernandez, the Spanish prisoner who actually speaks English. In a brief conversation with one of Zord's guards he realizes Zord is really crazy about tea leaves (the decoration on the ship, smell coming from Zord's quarters, Zord's speech should all lead into this.) Fran is also a nervous, rambling character who reveals the rumor of the magical tea leaf. Fernandez's inconsistent storytelling (and at the time he tells it, we don't know if he's lying or not) will immediately signal a sense of unease and comic potential. But his description of the magical tea leaf vaguely resembles the "Dragon's Breath" from Zord's dream, or at least Zord thinks so today, because he **believes** his dream is a prophecy. 

* **II. Rising Action**
    *  **Following the Clue:** Baratony, fueled by the rumor, sets sail, acting upon Fernandez's increasingly unreliable directions. This section involves some slapstick encounters – navigational mishaps, misunderstandings, and maybe a brief skirmish with a less-than-threatening local navy.

    *  **The Tavern:** Baratony finds a town of the coast. He introduces himself to the tavern owner as Zord, and **miraculously** the tavern owner (who is also an offbeat character) has heard of a passionate tea lover called Zord. This comes in handy, because a local Spanish army outfit acting on anonymous tip, raids the tavern. But the Spaniards are looking for infamous pirate Baratony Blackwood. After a brief hilarious word exchange with the Spaniards, where it threatens to arise into a full blown conflict that could destroy the entire joint, the tavern owner say something along these lines "This man ain't some boring Baratony from Plymouth, England. He's Zord. A world renowned tea connoisseur." It helps that Zord had plenty of tea leaves with him at the moment, and that - **look at this miracle** - the Spanish commander has also heard about Zord, because he too, loves to drink tea. It is the Spanish commander that then tells Zord about the island where some claim you can find extravagant tea leaves that Zord vaguely described.

    *  **The Island:** Baratony arrives at a seemingly deserted island, rumored to be the home of the "Dragon’s Breath" tea. With only his most reliable men, counting not more than 15 he starts to explore, while the rest of the crew remains at the ship. The island itself should be odd – overgrown ruins, strange rock formations, possibly some bizarre wildlife.
    
* **III. Climax**

    *  **The Tea Leaf:** Baratony discovers the tea leaf that looks less dramatically "magical" and more ridiculously rare. But the tea leaves are guarded by a flock of surprisingly territorial parrots. After some hilarious struggle, Baratony chases away the parrots and starts collecting the leaves.

    *  **The Reaction:** Baratony makes some mambo-jumbo tea, consumes it and experiences something mildly amusing, but definitely not a superhero transformation. He likely has a peculiar reaction – maybe he starts speaking fluent parrot or develops an uncontrollable urge to organize his crew’s belongings. Then, a "Parrot Tribe" arrives. This is the indigenous tribe of this island with special connections to the parrots that Baratony chased away. Their headgear even resembles the heads of the local parrot population, and they are pissed and ready to fight.
     
    *  **Resolution:** Baratony, now in full Zord persona, tries to schmooze the tribe. But this time, his absurd speech with plenty of wild hand gestures, fails to resonate with the Parrot Tribe. They don't even understand him. Chaotic and hilarious fight start, and Zord is eventually overwhelmed. The story concludes with Baratony tied, getting dragged by the tribe, but his Zord persona is stronger than ever. He even warns them that when "The tea fully kicks in, he's gonna pluck all their feathers like a peasant plucks chicken before serving it as dinner on the King's castle." As the sun sets, this is the last we hear from the pirate Captain Baratony Blackwood, also known as Zord.
