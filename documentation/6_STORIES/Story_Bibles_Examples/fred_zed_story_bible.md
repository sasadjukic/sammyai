## Fred and Zed story bible

**Title:** Fred and Zed: Not Yet Another Zombie Story

**Genre:** Comedy

**Story Type:** Short story

**Story Summary:** Fred and Zed, two zombies who do not have an instinctual hunger for living flesh, stumble into a musical festival near a small town in the USA and get to experience what it means to be a rockstar... at least for a few minutes.

**Story Settings**: The story takes place in a rural area between New Mexico and Arizona border during a nascent of zombie outbreak. A massive music festival Toxic Vibe attracts tens of thousands from across country. And this year is special because legendary hard rock band Bliss is set to perform.

**Protagonists:** 
Fred and Zed are two zombies who suffer from the "Ghrelin Syndrome" and do not have cravings for brains and human flash. Instead, Fred and Zed crave for friendship and good vibes. Fred is taller and slimmer with a full set of hair, while Zed is shorter, bald and wears glasses.

* **1. Fred and Zed Core Personalities & Philosophy:**
    * **Peace & Love:** They genuinely believe in non-violence, communal living, and good vibes.
    * **Chill & Mellow:** They move slowly not because they're brain-dead, but because they're just *that* relaxed. Nothing rushes them.
    * **Misunderstood "Hunger:** Instead of brains, maybe they "hunger" for: 
        * 1. Connection: They want to share stories, listen to music, just be with people.
        * 2. Good Vibes: They are drawn to places of peace, music, or communal gathering (which, ironically, usually become places of panic when they show up).
    * **Nature Lovers:** Their decaying state could be seen by them as "being one with the earth." They might try to hug trees (and cause them to rot).
    * **Simple Pleasures:** They enjoy the feeling of sunshine, a gentle breeze, or the simple act of shambling together.

* **2. Fred and Zed Communication Style:**
    * **Vocabulary:** They like talking and are able to speak almost like humans, but often their talk is slurred or guttural. Words they use the most:
        * Man
        * Dude
        * Chill
        * Groovy
        * Peace (often mistaken for a growl)
        * Brains (if they say it, it's not for eating, but perhaps meaning "let's use our collective intellect, man" or "wow, that's a good thought, *brain*.")
    
* **3. Misinterpreted Gestures:**
    * A slow wave could look like a lunge.
    * An attempt at a hug could look like an attack.
    * Offering a "peace offering" (like a half-decomposed flower or a moldy piece of fruit) would naturally be seen as disgusting or threatening.
    
**Bliss Band**: Bliss band is a parody for famous rock band Kiss. Bliss members are famous for their make ups, outfits and glam live performances.

**Story Breakdown:**
* **1. Exposition**
    * **Opening:** We open with two zombies walking out of forest, heading towards the gas station. They don't talk, or act in any special way. They just walk, keeping our readers questioning their motives. A family wagon pulls off from the gas station, a child spots two zombies, makes a funny comment. A mom freaks out, dad steps on the gas pedal as car signs the road and speeds. The next we see a gas station attendant (older, perhaps an owner of the gas station) reading a magazine. The radio hums country music in the background. A zombie hand puts two candy bars at the counter, surprising the gas station attendant. He looks up, sees two zombies, and freaks out. He flees the gas station before taller of the two zombies can even say a word.
    * **Meet the Zombies:** Two zombies look at each other. Sure, they look scary. But when they start talking... these guys are not dangerous, they're funny and they are shocked that people are scared of them. If there is a such thing as hipster zombies, than these two guys are them. They discuss why would people be scared of them? Does a romantic country music coming from the radio making people soft? One of the zombies changes stations on the radio, stops at the station playing rock music. They like rock. The zombies make themselves at home in the gas station. 
    * **Introducing Fred and Zed:** Two zombies come out of employee area. This time they wear corporate gas station shirts with employee tags on them. They read "Fred" on the taller zombie, and "Zed" on the shorter zombie. They got cigarettes and booze. As they loiter between the aisles, they discuss junk food, people, and good times. Then, from the radio station, announcer starts talking about opening day of Toxic Vibe music festival. The famous hard rock band Bliss is set to perform. The radio plays a Bliss' song. Fred and Zed instantly click, they need to go to the Toxic Vibe festival.
    
* **2. Rising Action**
    * **Arrival at the Toxic Vibe Festival:** Armed with a grocery cart overflowing with booze, cigarettes, and sugary candies, Fred and Zed, in their corporate shirts, boldly attempt to breach the Toxic Vibe festival’s back entrance, utterly oblivious to their own disruptive power. Employing a remarkably logical (and utterly flawed) assessment – ‘if that chain-link was supposed to stop anybody, it wouldn't have been so weak’ – they proceed to dismantle the security perimeter with a combination of shambling enthusiasm and surprising force. Their bizarre appearance, coupled with the hazy atmosphere of the backstage VIP area (where everyone’s already slightly disoriented from booze and music), leads to a comical mistaken identity – they’re hailed as catering staff, cementing their utterly absurd place within the heart of the festival. Some VIP girls offer them a joint, they take it and love it.
    * **The Bliss backstage VIP:** Fred and Zed make it to the Bliss VIP Area. They attempt to "understand" the rock star lifestyle, leading to a series of baffling actions – trying to emulate the band’s movements, attempting to jam along to the music, offering unsolicited advice to the band and zombie-centric gifts (a half-eaten mushroom, a moldy flower). The Bliss members, already under the influence, try zombie mushrooms and moldy flowers and get knocked unconscious. 
    * **Panic:** Fred and Zed panic, trying to bring the band members back to consciousness, but fail. A festival attendant (from the outside) warns the band needs to get ready for the stage. Fred and Zed put on the Bliss shirts, pants and leather jackets. No need for make up, they already look the part. A festival attendant walks in, Fred and Zed are on their way, holding the guitars and everything. The attendant comments on what he thinks is the bands make up: "You guys outdid yourself today"
   
* **3. Climax**
    * **New Bliss:** Fred and Zed step on the stage in front of thousands unsuspecting passionate fans. The fans love the looks and think this is all part of the performance. The energy, the moment, the opportunity... Fred and Zed soak it all in. Fred picks up the microphone, ask a few from the crowd to join them at stage for drums and bass guitar. The crowd goes wild. Fred tells the crowd they'll play a "new song" just for them. The song is called: Not Yet Another Zombie Story.
    * **The Rockstars:** It's a rough start for the new Bliss. They're out of sync and off to a weak start. The crowd is starting to cool off, but then... something clicks. The bend gets it together. Zed rips a guitar solo, Fred kicks in the lyrics. The crowd goes berserk. But outside of the festival gates, armored SWAT vehicles close in. The gas station attendant from the beginning of the story, Bud, joined by SWAT officers, points to Fred and Zed.
    * **The End:** SWAT rough up the way through the crowd. Police sirens are starting to drown the song. But the problem is many of the festival goers are cosplaying as zombies, making SWAT work much difficult. Fred and Zed, lost in their own world, feeding of the crowds energy, are still ripping it. Until a shotgun blows up the surround sound and drowns the stage in silence. The crowd disperses, Fred and Zed refer to SWAT as "people with bad vibes". Bliss' manager John, rushes on the stage and shows Fred and Zed a way out, thinking they are Bliss members. Fred and Zed exit Toxic Vibe fest in a similar way they entered it, cutting the metal fence. Once in the clearance, they reflect on their experience...
