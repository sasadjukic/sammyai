# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Everything you need to know about SammyAI—from technical requirements to creative capabilities.

## 1. Technical Prerequisites & Setup

### **What are the system requirements for running SammyAI?**
To ensure a smooth experience with local LLM execution and memory-intensive features like RAG, we recommend the following:

- **Memory (RAM)**: 16GB (Minimum required for reliable RAG processing and multi-tasking).
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (or equivalent) with at least 8GB VRAM is highly recommended.
- **CPU**: Modern multi-core processor (Intel i5/AMD Ryzen 5 or better).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These specifications align with the requirements for **Gemma 3:4B**. While the model may function on lower-end hardware, performance stability and response speeds may be significantly impacted.

### **Why are only four LLM models included as default?**
We have curated a selection of models known for their high-quality reasoning and creative output. This provides a stable starting point for users while keeping the initial footprint manageable.

### **Why are Anthropic and OpenAI models not included by default?**
Access to premium models from Anthropic and OpenAI requires paid API subscriptions. To keep SammyAI a cost-effective tool accessible to everyone, we prioritize high-performance open-source and free-tier models. We may consider integration options for these providers in future updates.

## 2. Creative Capabilities & Content

### **What is the default language for SammyAI?**
SammyAI is currently optimized for **US English** for both conversational interaction and narrative output.

### **Will SammyAI support languages other than US English?**
Expanding language support is a long-term goal. To maintain our standard of quality, this would require collaboration with native speakers for extensive testing across different linguistic nuances.

### **Does SammyAI permit writing crime, violence, or adult content?**
Yes. SammyAI is designed to support the full spectrum of creative storytelling, including fictional crime, violence, and mature themes. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend an iterative approach when exploring complex or extreme themes. We are actively monitoring model performance in these areas to ensure consistent quality and creative freedom.

### **Can SammyAI be used for non-fiction or professional content?**
- **Journalism**: While SammyAI's creative tools are robust, it has not been specifically benchmarked for news reportage. 
- **Social Media/Content Creation**: Initial results indicate that SammyAI is highly effective for drafting scripts, social posts, and content outlines when provided with the correct context and tone.

### **Can SammyAI write poetry or songs?**
While SammyAI can generate rhythmic text, it is not currently specialized for the highly specific structures required for professional-grade poetry and songwriting.

## 3. Editor Features & Development

### **Why does the editor lack advanced formatting (fonts, bolding, etc.)?**
SammyAI is designed as a **distraction-free writing environment**. Our priority is deep LLM integration to help you overcome writer’s block and focus on the narrative. We view the editor as a "strategic scratchpad" for generative drafting and high-level revision.

### **Will SammyAI support formats like .odt or .docx?**
We initially launched with `.txt` and `.md` due to their near-universal compatibility. We are evaluating support for `.odt` and `.docx` to better integrate with traditional publishing and word processing workflows.
