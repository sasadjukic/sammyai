# AI Models Overview

SammyAI is designed to be a versatile companion for creative writers, leveraging both the privacy of local computation and the immense power of cloud-based artificial intelligence. By integrating a curated selection of state-of-the-art models, SammyAI provides a truly accessible and powerful writing experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Stage of Development**
> The models listed below represent the selection used at the current stage of SammyAI's development. As the platform evolves, we may add or adjust these selections to ensure you always have access to the best tools for your creative process.

## Current Model Selection

We have carefully chosen a mix of local and cloud models to balance performance, cost, and reliability:

| Model | Provider | Type | Core Strength |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gemma 3 (4B)** | Local (Ollama) | Local | High privacy, no internet required, offline draft assistance. |
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash** | Google | Cloud | Exceptional speed, deep reasoning, and complex plot management. |
| **Kimi K2 (1T)** | Ollama Cloud | Cloud | Massive context handling for world-building and rich storytelling. |
| **DeepSeek V3.2** | Ollama Cloud | Cloud | Great reasoning, large context suitable for creative writing. |

## Local vs. Cloud Models

- **Local Models:** Run directly on your machine. They offer maximum privacy, your data never leaves your device.
- **Cloud Models:** Connected via secure APIs. They offer significantly higher "creative intelligence" and reasoning capabilities, making them ideal for complex story arcs or deep research.

## Accessing Cloud Power (API Keys)

To use the powerful cloud models (Gemini, Kimi, and DeepSeek), you must obtain your own **API keys**. This allows SammyAI to connect directly to the model providers on your behalf.

> [!TIP]
> **Getting an API key is easy and free!**
> Some providers offer free tiers with generous daily limits that are more than sufficient for individual creative writing.
> - **Free of Charge:** You don't need a subscription to get started.
> - **Quick Setup:** Obtaining a key usually takes just a few clicks from the provider's developer console.
> - **Generous Limits:** Free daily quotas vary by providers, but typically allow for enough to get you going with your stories.

We will go into specific details on how to set up each model in the following chapters.
